# Tanksley Designs

A static site built from scratch with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Introduction

This site was built as my portfolio site to showcase all of the
developer projects I've made since learning to code. While building the
site I learned a lot about using flexbox and grid efficiently as well as
using clip-paths and text animation. Swiper.js was used along with Bootstrap
cards to create the carousel for the project section.
